# Earlybird Community user free registration program

💥💥💥Good news！The earlybirds of FullOn public chain community users are now blessed!🚀🚀🚀

In order to foster faster development of FullOn public chain community, the FullOn foundation team has decided to provide the following free registration plan:

1. For the first `100,000` accounts to be registered on-chain, users will be given a free registration service to get their accounts registered or activated on-chain; After exhaustion of the free-bird quota, users will have to acquire a certain amount of $FLON in order to register new accounts or get help from other account holders who can pay $FLON for the users to have their accounts registered;
2. The $FLON tokens to support the free registration are all from the community airdrop allocation;
3. There can be about 10 FLON transfers maximum without requiring extra gas fees with the free account registration, after which users would have to acuire more FLON tokens in order to pay gas fees in future transactions.

P.S. FullOn Testnet has been successfuly launched in April 11, 2025 [FullOn Testnet](https://testnet.flonscan.io), and the mainnet will be launched after thorough and successful testing of the testnet. Please stay tuned for the mainnet launch！
