# Earlybird Community user free registration program

💥💥💥Good news！The earlybirds of FullOn public chain community users are now blessed!🚀🚀🚀

As FullOn network supports abstract accounts that need to be registered on-chain before any meaningful use,  the FullOn foundation team has decided to provide the free registration plan in order to foster faster development of FullOn public chain community.

## Program details

1. For the first `1,000,000` accounts to be registered on-chain, users will be given a free registration service to get their accounts registered or activated on-chain; After exhaustion of the free-bird quota, users will have to acquire a certain amount of $FLON in order to register new accounts or get help from other account holders who can pay $FLON for the users to have their accounts registered;
2. The $FLON tokens to support the free registration are all from the `community airdrop allocation`;
3. There can be about 18 FLON transfers with available gas fees out of the free account registration, after which users would have to acquire FLON tokens in order to pay gas fees in future transactions.

## Important tips

1. User must install `HuFu Wallet` in order to access the free registration feature/program;
2. The same device can be only be used once to finish the free registration process and the subsequent account registration on the same device will require FLON tokens to be paid;
3. HuFu Wallet can be downloaded from [https://hufu.io](https://hufu.io)
