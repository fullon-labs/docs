# What are FullOn's ecosystems

FullOn virtually supports infinite number of ecosystems due to her scalability and cability in building applications and services.

However, FullOn's core team has partnered with several Web3 and AI builders to build up several core ecosystems as following:

1. ***Web3***

- **Music**: revolutionize the music industry through tokenizing the music economy such that the music fans, artists, agents and merchants... etc will be all fairly rewarded and incentivized in a timely manner through on-chain smart-contract driven activities 

- **Exchange**: Instead of relying on centralized exchanges (CEX) for traders to buy and sell tokens, FullOn encourages communities to leverage eithr Swap-based or Order-book based DEXes to trade to foster a rule-based and transparent trading environment.

- **Others**: DeFi (stake/lend/earn) and PayFi, ...etc will be gradually introduced into the platform.

2. ***A.I.***

FullOn provides a decentralization foundation to the A.I. world where A.I. computing resources, contents and agents shrine the most.

Through ecosystem partners, FullOn let AI related digital entities have their on-chain identities and even token assets. FullOn will be also inviting AI builders to create an open market for A.I. computing resources, A.I. generated contents and versatile A.I. agents to be traded and accessed in a decentralized manner.


3. ***Social***

FullOn believes in a wide-ranged social collabration amongst individuals including human users, human agents or virtual agents. Each user will have their on-chain footprint and credit points recorded in a real-time fashion which will be a cornerstone to the credit-driven social interaction and collaboration environment. Furthermore, users will be rewarded with ecosystem points for completing on-chain tasks.
